SlipStream Tutorial
===================

This hands-on tutorial demonstrates the core features of SlipStream by
building a number of example applications through a series of exercises.  The
tutorial shows how SlipStream:

 - Abstracts away differences between clouds, making **cloud portability**
   possible,
 - Speeds application development by **promoting reuse** of parameterized
   application components,
 - Ensures **consistent, fast, and error-free deployment** of
   applications through automation,
 - Coordinates the configuration of an application's component
   services to ensure **reliable initialization**,
 - Improves reliability through geo-redundant services in
   **multi-cloud deployments**,
 - Provides **universal access** through a web-base UI, command line
   interface, and a REST API, and
 - Optimizes resource use though **horizontal and vertical scaling**.

The tutorial is divided into a number of modules that treat specific
topics (see the Table of Contents).  The first two provide an overview
of the cloud ecosystem and SlipStream concepts.  These provide a good
foundation for understanding the core SlipStream functionality that is
presented in Module III.  The subsequent modules treat more advanced
topics and can be followed in any order.

The exercises provided in the tutorial build on one another starting
from a simple, single machine web server and ending with an
auto-scalable distributed multi-component application. Solutions to
the exercises can be found on Nuvla.
