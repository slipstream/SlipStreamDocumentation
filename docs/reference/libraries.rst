Libraries
=========

Although SlipStream's RESTful API can be consumed directly, it is
sometimes easier to use a library that wraps the RESTful interface to
allow for more idomatic use from a given programming language.

Clojure(Script)
---------------

A complete Clojure API is provided.  This library provides
full-featured synchronous and asynchronous clients.  The asynchronous
client is compatible with ClojureScript and can be used in JavaScript
runtime environments.

The `Clojure API source code
<https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamClojureAPI>`_ is in GitHub
and the `Clojure API documentation
<https://slipstream.github.com/SlipStreamClojureAPI>`_ is hosted in
GitHub Pages.

Python
------

A complete Python API is provided.  This native library provided a
full coverage of the SlipStream features.  The `Python API source code
<https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamPythonAPI>`_ is hosted in
GitHub with the `Python API documentation
<https://slipstream.github.io/SlipStreamPythonAPI/>`_ in GitHub Pages.

There is also a Libcloud Driver for SlipStream that supports the basic
cloud application management features.  As for the other libraries,
the `Libcloud driver source code
<https://github.com/slipstream/slipstream-libcloud-driver>`_ is in
GitHub with the `Libcloud Driver Documentation
<https://slipstream.github.io/slipstream-libcloud-driver/>`_ in GitHub
Pages.
