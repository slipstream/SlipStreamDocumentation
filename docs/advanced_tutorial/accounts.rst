Accounts
========

SlipStream is a secure web application that allows individuals to access
one or more cloud infrastructures transparently. Separate accounts are
required for all users to allow them to keep their work private and to
protect their cloud credentials.

To work with SlipStream you must have:

-  A valid account on the SlipStream server and
-  An account on one or more cloud infrastructures.

SlipStream supports nearly all major cloud service providers and open
source cloud solutions.

.. tip::

    This tutorial assumes that you're using the SlipStream SaaS operated
    by SixSq at https://slipstream.sixsq.com. If you're using another
    instance, just replace the SaaS endpoint with your endpoint.

.. tip::

    Most of the tutorial is independent of the chosen cloud providers,
    but where necessary for concrete examples, this tutorial will
    provide instructions for the `Exoscale <https://www.exoscale.ch>`__
    and `Ultimum <https://ulticloud.com>`__ cloud infrastructures.

SlipStream Account
------------------

You can register for a SlipStream account directly through the service.
The procedure follows the usual steps for web application registration
and hopefully is clear without instructions. Just in case the details
are:

1. Fill in the registration form on the SlipStream `welcome
   page <https://slipstream.sixsq.com>`__; you only need to provide a
   username and an email address.
2. You will receive an email to verify the email address that you
   provided.
3. Visit the URL provided in that email, either by clicking on the link
   or copying it into your browser.
4. You will see a web page acknowledging that you've verified your email
   address.
5. You will then receive a second email with a temporary password for
   your account.
6. Visit the SlipStream `welcome page <https://slipstream.sixsq.com>`__
   and log in with your username and temporary password.
7. View your user profile by hovering over your username in the page
   header and then clicking on "Profile".
8. Change your temporary password by clicking on "Edit", updating the
   password fields and then clicking on "Save".

You will also need to provide cloud credentials and optionally an SSH
public key to make full use of SlipStream. The configuration steps are
provided below.

Cloud Infrastructure Accounts
-----------------------------

You will also need to provide the credentials for at least one cloud
infrastructure before being able to use SlipStream to deploy cloud
applications.

The procedure is similar for all cloud services, but you may need to
contact your cloud administrator for all of the necessary configuration
parameters. The detailed procedure is provided for Exoscale and Ultimum
below.

Exoscale
--------

If you need to create an account at Exoscale, you can visit their
`registration page <https://exoscale.ch/register>`__.

Once you've obtained your account with Exoscale, then you'll need to
provide your Exoscale credentials to SlipStream. To find the information
you need in the Exoscale portal:

1. Click on the "Account" icon on the left after logging into the
   Exoscale portal.
2. Click to open the "API Keys" tab.
3. You will need to the "API Key" and "Secret Key" for the SlipStream
   configuration.

Add your Exoscale credential to your SlipStream account:

1. Open your user profile.
2. Click on "Edit".
3. Open the section "exoscale-ch-gva" by clicking on the section header.
4. Provide the "API Key" value in the "Key" field and the "Secret Key"
   value in the "Secret" field.
5. Click on "Save".

You will now be able to use the Exoscale cloud with your account through
SlipStream.

Ultimum
-------

If you need to create an account at Ultimum, you can visit their
`registration page <https://console.ulticloud.com/registration/>`__.

Once you've obtained your account with Ultimum, then you'll need to
provide your Ultimum credentials (username and password) to SlipStream.
The username is your email address.

Add your Ultimum credential to your SlipStream account:

1. Open your user profile.
2. Click on "Edit".
3. Open the section "ultimum-cz1" by clicking on the section header.
4. Provide values for your username (email), password, and "Project name
   (Tenant name). Your "Project name" is the same as your username.
5. Click on "Save".

You will now be able to use the Ultimum cloud with your account through
SlipStream.
