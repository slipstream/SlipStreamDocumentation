Roadmap
=======

SixSq produces a new, incremental release of SlipStream approximately
every two weeks.  Those "candidate" releases are deployed on Nuvla to
allow everyone to benefit from bugfixes and new features.

SixSq promotes a release to "stable" about once a quarter.  These
releases are fully supported by SixSq and recommended for other
production deployments. 

The release notes for all releases are available on the `SlipStream
documentation website <http://ssdocs.sixsq.com>`__.

In addition to the continual bugfixing, robustness, and usability
improvements, there are several areas where important new
functionality is planned:

- Connectors: Continued expansion of the supported cloud
  infrastructures 
- APIs: A gradual shift away from our custom REST API towards the CIMI
  standard, accompanied by a shift from XML to JSON. 
- Storage: Incorporating storage (block and object) as first-class
  resources within the SlipStream computing model
- Containers: Support for container-based technologies in addition to
  virtual machine technologies
- Networking: component-level control of firewall rules and dynamic
  control over network connectivity and quality

Your feedback on what features you'd like to see in SlipStream is
important.  We continuously adjust our development priorities based on
user feedback.  Give us your feedback by contacting us at
