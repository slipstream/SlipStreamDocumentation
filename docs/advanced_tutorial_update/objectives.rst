Training Objectives
===================

This hands-on training course will demonstrate the core features of
SlipStream through the incremental development of two applications: a
simple web server and a complete multi-tiered web application. 

The covered SlipStream features include:

 - Abstracting away cloud differences to make cloud portability
   possible. 
 - Creating portable definitions of simple and complex cloud
   applications. 
 - Multi-cloud
 - Definition and management of application through the web UI
 - Management of applications through the SlipStream CLI and REST API
 - Parameterizing application components for independent testing and
   reuse 
 - Coordinating application components through run parameters
 - Scaling applications to respond to changes in application load
 - Optimization of application components by "building" images

This tutorial provides a quick overview of the cloud ecosystem and
describes where SlipStream fits in. After that, it describes the key
features of SlipStream and how to get started using it. The final part
of the tutorial is a series of examples that demonstrate specific
features of SlipStream. As the examples build on one another and become
increasingly more complex, readers will want to follow the tutorial in
order.
