Software Architecture
=====================

Software stack
--------------

NuvlaBox is built on top of a robust Open Source foundation:

- Operating System: CentOS
- Cloud layer - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): OpenNebula
- App Store - Platform as a Service (PaaS): SlipStream

Virtualisation is performed using KVM. No other cloud appliance provides this level of functionality and integration.

A bunch of services are being used to make the NuvlaBox system easy to use and highly configurable:

Nginx - Hsqldb - ElasticSearch - Hostapd - Dnsmasq - Iptables - Collectd - Graphite - Carbon-cache - Chrony
- OverlayFS - Watchdog - Custom utilities - etc.
