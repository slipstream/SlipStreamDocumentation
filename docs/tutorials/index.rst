This hands-on training course demonstrates the core features of SlipStream and
NuvlaBox.

The course is built of sufficiently autonomous learning modules covering
different aspects of the solutions.  It is assembled so that it's possible to
follow it independently for SlipStream or NuvlaBox while, whenever necessary,
bridging the two.

The path through the tutorial is cross referenced, providing the hints and
guidelines on the most suitable module/section to follow after completion of
a current one.

.. important::

   The command line examples throughout the tutorial use Linux bash
   syntax.  If you're using a different shell (csh, PowerShell, etc.),
   you'll need to adjust the syntax accordingly.
