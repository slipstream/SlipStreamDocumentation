Module II - SlipStream Web Interface Tour (Basic)
-------------------------------------------------

This model lists the prerequisites for working with SlipStream and
then guides you through the core features via the embedded SlipStream
tour.  As part of this tour, you will deploy your first application on
a cloud with SlipStream.  You will also learn to view and edit your
user profile, allowing you to set important parameters and provide
credentials for the cloud infrastructures you want to use.

This module presumes familiarity with cloud technologies and the key
concepts of SlipStream.  Review :doc:`Module I <module-1>` if this is
not the case.
