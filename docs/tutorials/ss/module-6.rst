Module VI - Data Management
---------------------------

S3 (Simple Storage Service) object storage has become a de facto
standard since its introduction by Amazon Web Services in 2006.  IaaS
cloud infrastructures and cloud software provide S3-compatible object
storage nearly universally.

SlipStream takes advantage of cloud infrastructures' object storage
and its own Service Catalog to solve the problem of managing data in a
multi-cloud environment.

.. note::

   This functionality is in **active development** and not all of the
   described features are available. We welcome feedback on all
   aspects of the data management proposal and those features that
   have been implemented.
