What is a NuvlaBox?
===================

NuvlaBox is a simple and secure private cloud solution that offers
easy and affordable access to the benefits of cloud computing.  It is
a plug & play device with remote management and application update
capabilities. It can be easily and securely deployed by a
non-technical operator.  The NuvlaBox’s ability to work both
autonomously and as a remote controlled connected device gives great
flexibility, supporting a diverse set of deployment scenarios.

How does it work?
-----------------

The customer can decide which applications should be pre-installed in
the NuvlaBox.  The boxes are then shipped directly to the customer’s
location. Once on site, simply connect the NuvlaBox(es) to a power
supply and a network device.  The NuvlaBoxes can then be locally or
remotely operated. When connected to the network, new applications can
also be downloaded and installed on any box, remotely, at the click of
a button.
