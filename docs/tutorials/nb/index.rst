NuvlaBox Tutorial
=================

* nuvlabox-defined
Concept (IoT, EdgeComputing).

* hw-arch
Hardware Architecture
 - Types, specifications, capabilities.

* supply-chain
Supply chain. Logicsupply (https://www.logicsupply.com) assemble and initialize
the boxes based on our specs (individualized boxes).  In Amsterdam or
Burlington (US).

* boot-and-use
Power up / Start / Boot / Connect

* sw-arch
Software Architecture (services / network / etc.)
 - cloud solution (opened locally and for remote SlipStream)
 - SlipStream (local instance)
 - networking
 - ???

* remote-ss
Connection/relation with SlipStream. (Ref. to SS)

* deploy-app
Deploying Applications on NuvlaBox

* management
Management of NuvlaBox
- Installation from scratch
- Updates (possible by design, but not maintained for the moment)
- Configuration with Admin UI

* build-and-run-apps
Building and Running Applications
 - conventional applications (there is no differece between running on a cloud
   or NuvlaBox; link to SS tutorial)
 - sensor-based applications
   - example: app using external USB camera.

* usages
Usage Scenarios
 - IoT
 - EdgeComputing

* roadmap
Ideas for the future extension and improvement of NuvlaBox.
