Prerequisities
==============

The SlipStream server has a standard, n-tier web application
architecture: the application runs within a Java web application
container and stores data within SQL and NoSQL (document oriented)
databases. Consequently, many administrators will be familiar with
its configuration needs and modest resource requirements.

Software Requirements
---------------------

The software is tested, packaged, and supported for CentOS 7 systems.
The packages should install and run correctly on any RHEL 7 compatible
system. The software itself should build and run on any Unix-like
system, although some changes may be needed for integration with the
operating system's service management infrastructure.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

The hardware requirements of SlipStream are modest. Any modern,
multicore, server-class machine should run the server without problems.
At least 2 gigabytes of RAM should be dedicated to the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) running the service. Similarly 10-20 GB of disk space
should be sufficient for initial use.

As with any service, the resource requirements for the server will
increase with the number of users and with the number of user application
deployments. Use a larger machine if you expect particularly large scale
or intense use of the service.

Networking Requirements
-----------------------

SlipStream is available through a web-proxy through the standard HTTPS
(443) port. In addition, the proxy redirects all traffic on the HTTP
(80) port to the HTTPS port. Consequently, firewalls on the machine or
site must allow access to the HTTPS port from the users' machines; they
may also allow access to the HTTP port.

To administer and monitor the machine running the SlipStream service,
you may also want to have the SSH port (22) and the Nagios NRPE port
(5666) open to your administrators' and monitoring machines.

The configured SlipStream connectors act as clients of the corresponding
cloud service provider. Consequently, the server must also have
*outgoing* access to the underlying cloud service endpoints. The ports
used vary depending on the cloud service provider.

For any cloud service provider that does not support a virtual machine
contextualization mechanism, the server requires direct SSH access (port
22) to virtual machines within those clouds.

Cloud Requirements
------------------

SlipStream is a cloud deployment engine and requires access to at least
one supported cloud infrastructure. See the list of supported clouds and
conditions on the associated cloud plugin to select the cloud(s) you
will be making available through your SlipStream instance.
