SlipStream API
==============

SlipStream uses a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) and exposes a
complete REST API over HTTP(S). To ensure consistency, the service's web
interface directly uses the underlying SlipStream API.

If you're a developer looking to integrate SlipStream into your
application DevOps processes, then direct use of the API will facilitate
that integration. The `complete API
documentation <http://ssapi.sixsq.com>`__ can be found on a separate,
dedicated site.
