Module III - Creating, Deploying, and Managing Cloud Applications (Basic)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module provides detailed information about the creation,
deployment and management of applications.  Once you've completed it,
you'll be able to build, deploy, and share your own applications on
clouds of your choice.

This module builds on the knowledge acquired about Slipstream in the
previous module :doc:`Module II <module-2>`. Your user profile must
contain credentials for at least one cloud.  If necessary, review the
:doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>` from the previous module.

After finishing this module, building, deploying and managing cloud
applications should no longer be a problem for you, especially with
such a powerful tool as SlipStream in your DevOps_ tool belt.

You are now prepared for the remaining advanced modules.  Choose those
that interest you.  See :doc:`Module IV <module-4>` for (auto-)scaling
your cloud applications or :doc:`Module V <module-5>` for interacting
with SlipStream via its API and optimizing your deployments.
