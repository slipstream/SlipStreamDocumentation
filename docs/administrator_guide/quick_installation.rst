Quick Installation
==================

An automated installation script is available to install SlipStream and
all of its dependencies on a CentOS 7 machine.

This script will do the following actions on your machine:

-  Configure SlipStream yum repositories
-  Configure epel yum repositories
-  Configure nginx yum repository
-  Install SlipStream in /opt/slipstream
-  Install HSQLDB in /opt/hsqldb
-  Install nginx
-  Install some other dependencies with yum and python-pip
-  Disable SElinux
-  Configure nginx, HSQLDB and SlipStream
-  Replace the firewall configuration with the following:
-  Allow all outgoing packets
-  Allow loopback connections
-  Allow incoming ICMP requests
-  Allow incoming SSH connections (port 22)
-  Allow incoming HTTP connections (port 80)
-  Allow incoming HTTPS connections (port 443)
-  Deny all other incoming connections
-  Deny forwarding
-  Start nginx, HSQLDB and SlipStream

These instructions assume that you will be using the prebuilt binary
packages for SlipStream. If you want to build your own packages from the
source, refer to the Developer Guide.

Run the quick installation script
---------------------------------

If you are going to install the enterprise version of SlipStream you
have to install the certificate (yum-client.crt and yum-client.key)
provided by SixSq into ``/etc/slipstream/``.

.. warning::

    If you're behind a web proxy, see the `Installation via Web
    Proxy <#proxy_section>`__ section before starting.

The following command will take care of the installation of SlipStream.

The placeholder ``{edition}`` has to be replaced by ``community`` or
``enterprise``.

The placeholder ``{repokind}`` has to be replaced by ``snapshot``,
``candidate`` or ``release``

::

    $ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slipstream/SlipStream/master/install/slipstream-install.sh | bash -s {edition} {repokind}

Once the installation script is terminated a SlipStream server will be
running but without any connectors.

Cloud Connectors
----------------

If you have installed community edition of SlipStream, the quick install
script already installed all the open-source connectors.

If you have installed the enterprise edition, you have to install all
connectors you have a license for.

To install connectors simply execute the following command.

The placeholder ``{list of connector names}`` has to be replaced by the
list (space separated) of connector names to install.

The placeholder ``{repokind}`` has to have the same value as in the
previous command.

::

    $ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slipstream/SlipStream/master/install/ss-install-connectors.sh | bash -s -- -r {repokind} {list of connector names}

Once all needed connectors are installed, restart SlipStream with:

::

    $ systemctl restart slipstream

Testing the Service
-------------------

You should now be able to contact the SlipStream server with a web
browser using HTTPS; the URL should be ``https://your_machine/``. You
should be redirected to the login page that looks similar to the
following screenshot.

If everything looks good, you are ready to configure the server and
cloud connectors.

Configuration
-------------

To configure your SlipStream server you can either use the user
interface or drive the configuration from configuration files. Refer
to the dedicated :ref:`configuration files documentation page
<dg-cfg-files>` for more details.

This will allow you to define configuration for:

-  Connectors
-  Modules
-  Users
-  Cloud Ids

Installation via Web Proxy
--------------------------

If you are installing SlipStream from behind a web proxy, you'll need
some additional configuration to ensure that the scripts and packages
can be downloaded through the proxy. Set the following environmental
variables:

::

    http_proxy=http://user:password@ip_addr:3128/
    HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@ip_addr:3128/
    HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@ip_addr:3128/

replacing the ``user``, ``password``, and ``ip_addr`` with the
appropriate values. This allows the commands ``curl`` and ``rpm`` to
access everything.

In addition, you need to add the following lines to ``/etc/yum.conf``:

::

    # The proxy server - proxy server:port number
    proxy=http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3128
    # The account details for yum connections
    proxy_username=xxx
    proxy_password=yyy

again replacing the values as appropriate.

Set up Github external authentication
-------------------------------------

Since version 2.22, Github users can log in SlipStream with their Github account
(if a match is found between Github email and SlipStream email, existing SlipStream account
is then bound to the Github account, otherwise a new SlipStream user is created).

First, register this new SlipStream instance in Github: https://github.com/settings/applications/new.
The Homepage URL can be the SlipStream instance end point.
The Authorization callback URL must be <SlipStream end point>/auth/callback-github.
You will obtain a Github client ID and a Github secret (see next).

Then, edit authentication server configuration (/opt/slipstream/ssclj/resources/db.spec) with these
Github credentials. (Do not forget to provide values for :auth-server and :main-server entries).

Finally, restart ssclj service.

::

    $ systemctl restart ssclj
