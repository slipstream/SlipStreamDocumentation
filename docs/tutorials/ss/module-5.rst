Module V - Automation and Optimization (Advanced)
-------------------------------------------------

Instead of working with SlipStream via web browser interface, you may
want to use the SlipStream Command Line Interface (CLI) or the
SlipStream REST API. These are useful for scripting or interacting
with SlipStream via another service.

This module provides an overview of **SlipStream API** and
demonstrates how to authenticate with SlipStream and manage the full
lifecycle of applications.  The module also covers the SlipStream
**build image** feature, which optimizes application deployments by
minimizing start up latencies.

Cloud applications, like all things in the universe, break or go
wrong. See the section on **debugging of applications** to understand
how to troubleshoot problems efficiently.

If you've not done so already, you might want to follow :doc:`Module
IV <module-4>` to learn about scalable applications.
