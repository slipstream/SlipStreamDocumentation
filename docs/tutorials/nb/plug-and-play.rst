Here are the first things to do with the NuvlaBox:

3. Connect the NuvlaBoxâ€™s power cord to the mains and to the NuvlaBox
4. Push the power button

Using another device such as laptop, smartphone or tablet (not
included) connect to the NuvlaBox WiFi or LAN network.  This
connection give you access to a local SlipStream and allows you later
on to access your running virtual machines.

.. note:: Please follow :doc:`Module II </tutorials/ss/module-2>` of
          the SlipStream tutorial to learn the necessary basis about
          SlipStream.

You can treat the NuvlaBox as your private *mini* IaaS_ cloud.  As
with any IaaS Cloud you want a friendly SaaS_ or PaaS_ service to help
you with building and deploying applications on IaaS.  This is where
SlipStream comes into the picture.  SlipStream can be used to manage
your applications on your NuvlaBox(es) just like you can do for other
cloud infrastructures.

.. HINT:: If no DHCP is available in your network, you can connect to
   your LAN, access NuvlaBox admin UI and set a static IP for the
   NuvlaBox WAN interface.
