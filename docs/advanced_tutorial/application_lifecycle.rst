Application Lifecycle in Clouds
===============================

The lifecycle for applications running within a cloud infrastructure is
very similar to the lifecycle of an application running within a
traditional data center. The lifecycle involves:

1. Defining application components in the form of virtual machine images
2. Creating application by bringing together the individual components
3. Deploying the application on one or more cloud infrastructures
4. Validating the application to ensure that all the components are
   working correctly
5. Managing the application by monitoring the service and changing the
   allocated resources in response to load
6. Terminating the application when it is no longer needed

The only cloud-specific parts of the lifecycle involve the use of
virtual machines and a cloud service.

SlipStream facilitates the full application lifecycle by automating the
processes, capturing knowledge about the application, and fostering
reuse of that knowledge.
