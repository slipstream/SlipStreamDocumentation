v3.56 - 3 August 2018
---------------------

Release v3.56 has focused on improving the resource monitoring system
within SlipStream to improve its coverage, precision, and
reliability. In parallel, the usage dashboard has been improved to
allow users to search, visualize, and download the usage information
more efficiently.

In addition, a number of bugs were fixed and other enhancements have
been rolled in. 

For Everyone:
 - The usage dashboard available from the `newer web interface
   <https://nuv.la/webui>`_ has been significantly enhanced to provide
   better search (and sort) capabilities, to view data more
   efficiently, and to allow download of the report data.
 - As a result of the work on the usage dashboard, the newer web
   interface has been cleaned up, with more visual consistency between
   elements and many small interaction bugs corrected.
 - Fixed a bug that prevented the deployment reports from being shown
   in the web interfaces.
 - Fixed that caused user registration with a username/password to
   fail.

For Bob:
 - Recovery of quota information from cloud service providers
   (starting with Exoscale) has been put in place to allow
   synchronization between SlipStream and provider quotas.
 - Fixed the schema of the quotas to allow for zero limits,
   effectively blocking access to a particular resource.
 - Metering has been improved to ensure that the correct people have
   access to the records and that the information is more precise.

For Dave:
 - The logging for the job executor has been significantly improved.
   It now uses its own log file (rather than logging to syslog) and
   all messages have a consistent format and reasonable logging
   level. 
 - Support for both MITREid server and token authentication has been
   improved to allow a shared configuration of both authentication
   methods.

v3.55 - 21 July 2018
--------------------

Two features dominated the work for this release:

 - Enhancing the authentication process to allow users to authenticate
   with multiple methods for a single account and
 - Refining the monitoring infrastructure to provide more accurate and
   better overviews of resource usage.

In addition, a number of bugs were fixed and other enhancements have
been rolled in. 

For Everyone:
 - Fix a problem where external users making use of shared credentials
   could not terminate deployments.
 - Allow for user registration with an Exoscale voucher that
   automatically creates an Exoscale account and configures the Nuvla
   account for all Exoscale regions.
 - Change external authentication via MITREid (OIDC) servers to use
   unique identifier rather than the MITREid username.
 - Fix the user registration workflow for browser-based clients.
 - Fix an issue where specifying multiple SSH keys on an OpenStack
   deployment could prevent the key pair from being created.
 - Simplify the user login and user sign up modals.

For Clara:
 - Add full text search capabilities for the description attribute of
   CIMI resources. (Alpha feature subject to change.)
 - Add CIMI-based modules (images, components, applications) to the
   server. (Alpha feature subject to change.)

For Bob:
 - Add the concept of "credential managers" to allow for managers to
   have an overview of all resource usage related to the credential.
 - Add disk size monitoring for virtual machine resources.

For Dave:
 - Enhance the Exoscale connector to use a separate parameter for the
   root disk size, rather than relying on separate images with
   different default disk sizes.
 - Fix a minor (and rare) problem with the job engine where there was
   a missing format in exception handling that affected the logs.
 - Fix a problem with the handling of credentials when creating the
   monitoring resources for virtual machines.
 - Allow multiple identities per user account. (See the migration
   instructions below concerning this change.)
 - The self-registration template is not added by default.  This must
   be added by the administrator to authorize self-registration of
   users. 
 - The problem with the slow start of the CIMI server was caused by
   insufficient entropy.  It is recommended to always run the
   "haveged" service to avoid this problem.  This has been added to
   the standard SlipStream installation. 
 - Multiple fixes and additions to the WebUI interface.

v3.54 - 30 June 2018
--------------------

This release focused on improving the performance and reliability of
the SlipStream server.  This included identifying and fixing problems
with the monitoring subsystem, properly catching exceptions to ensure
relevant error messages for users, and improving the startup time for
the CIMI server.

For Everyone:
 - Improve monitoring subsystem to ensure that monitoring information
   for applications is not lost.
 - Streamlined user registration with an Exoscale coupon.  Creates
   accounts on SlipStream and Exoscale and automatically includes
   credentials in SlipStream.
 - Ensure the user receives relevant error messages and status codes
   by catching exceptions within the server related to invalid input
   and resource conflicts.

For Bob:
 - Fix UI issues for resource usage that would result in a blank page
   being presented.

For Dave:
 - Updated workflow to ensure that all user information is included in
   user registrations from OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers
   based on MITREid.
 - Provide simple job statistics on the WebUI to identify problems
   with the job subsystem.
 - The CIMI server was starting slowly because of insufficient entropy
   for cryptographic actions.  The SlipStream installation script now
   installs the "haveged" daemon.  This is recommended for all
   installations.

   it is added manually.

 - The CIMI server takes an extremely long time to start.  The cause
   of this is being investigated.

v3.53 - 16 June 2018
--------------------

The main changes for this release concern the user authentication and
registration features.  Those people using external identity providers
must first register with SlipStream; previously accounts were created
automatically.  This release expands support for OIDC servers and lays
the groundwork for linking multiple authentication methods to a single
account.

For Everyone:
 - Users identified via external identity providers must now
   explicitly register with SlipStream before being able to log into
   the service.
 - OpenID Connect (OIDC) support has been expanded to support the
   MITREid Connect implementation (in addition to the existing
   Keycloak support), allowing more external identity providers to be
   used.
 - Links to the Terms and Conditions document have been updated to
   those reflecting changing coming from the recent GDPR legislation.

For Alice:
 - Fix an issue for the ``ss-module-download`` utility that caused it
   to fail when the module contained non-ASCII characters.
 - Allow the ``ss-module-download`` utility to continue when errors
   (e.g. access permissions) occur.

For Dave:
 - The OpenStack connector now contains an option to use and reuse
   floating IP addresses from an allocated pool. (Patch provided by
   IFB.)
 - Fix issue where the NuvlaBox connector description would prevent
   the server from starting.

v3.52 - 2 June 2018
-------------------

This releases fixes the known issues from the previous release and
refactors the authentication processes to make them more robust and
more easily maintainable. For end-users, the primary changes are that
the CYCLONE authentication method is no longer supported and
SlipStream accounts are not created automatically for external logins
(e.g. via GitHub or OpenID Connect).

For Everyone:
 - Remove CYCLONE authentication support.  Users who were using that
   authentication method must use another one
   (e.g. username/password).
 - Fix display of version in footer.

For Dave:
 - Refactor authentication processes to use explicit callback
   resource.
 - Remove test dependencies leaking into production deployments.
 - Ensure that deployment-specific API key/secret credentials are
   cleaned up even when a deployment is aborted.
 - Fix job engine to use correct database index.

v3.51 - 18 May 2018
-------------------

This is a major release that updates the version of Elasticsearch and
changes the mapping of resources to Elasticsearch indices. This
impacts mainly SlipStream administrators.  **All upgrades require a
full migration of the database.**

For Dave:
 - Allow different database bindings to be configured for the server.
 - Provide alpha release for Elasticsearch binding based on its REST
   API. 
 - Simplify dependencies by taking SlipStream version from code rather
   than the service configuration.
 - Upgrade to Elasticsearch 6, separating indices for resources and
   providing explicit mappings.  This should improve performance and
   make management easier.
 - Change session resource expiry date to make it possible to clean up
   expired sessions with simple Elasticsearch queries.
 - Allow default ordering of events to be overridden through the API.

Alice, Bob, Clara, and Dave can be found
`here <http://sixsq.com/personae/>`_.

Migration
~~~~~~~~~

The version requires a full migration of the Elasticsearch
database.

Both the old and new Elasticsearch clusters must be accessible during
the migration process.  You must run the upgrade process from a
machine that can access both the old and new Elasticsearch
clusters. Normally, this is the machine running the SlipStream
services and we refer to this as the "SlipStream machine" below.

If you've not done so already, install a new `Elasticsearch 6 cluster
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html>`_. Use
the `health checks
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-health.html>`_
to ensure that the cluster is functioning correctly before starting
the migration process.  This must be on a different machine from the
one running your current production Elasticsearch cluster.

The first step is to download and setup the migration tools.  

 - On the SlipStream machine, `install the Leiningen build tool
   <https://leiningen.org/#install>`_.  This will be used to download
   the dependencies required by the migration tools and then to run
   them.
 - Ensure that Leiningen works by running ``lein --help``.  If it
   doesn't work, check the troubleshooting information on the
   Leiningen website.
 - Download the `SlipStreamMigration tarball
   <https://nexus.sixsq.com/content/repositories/releases-community-rhel7/com/sixsq/slipstream/SlipStreamMigration/3.51/SlipStreamMigration-3.51.tar.gz>`_
   that contains the migration tools.
 - Unpack these tools in a convenient location on the SlipStream
   machine.  The command to use is ``tar zxf
   SlipStreamMigration-3.51.tar.gz``.
 - **From the root of the unpacked tarball**, execute the command
   ``lein with-profile +dbinit run -- --help``.  Apologies for the
   tortured syntax. 

This last command should download a large number of dependencies and
end with usage information for the command.  If it does not, verify
that you are in the correct directory and that everything has been
setup correctly.  Contact support if you cannot resolve the issues.

The next step is to initialize the database with the indices and
mappings for the SlipStream resources. **This must be done before any
documents are migrated from the old database.**  Execute the following
commands::

  $ export ES_HOST=es6-01.example.com
  $ export ES_PORT=9300
  $ lein with-profile +dbinit,+community,+enterprise run

Replace the hostname with your Elasticsearch 6 host. The "+community"
and "+enterprise" initialize the database for the Community Edition
and Enterprise Edition cloud connectors, respectively.  Leave out
those terms if they are not appropriate for your SlipStream
installation.

Review the output from the dbinit tool.  You should see the successful
initialization of a large number of CIMI resources.  You can ignore
the zookeeper error concerning the initialization of the Job resource.

You can check the initialization by looking at the indices in
Elasticsearch::

  $ curl "http://$ES_HOST:9200/_cat/indices?v"

This should return a listing like the following::

  health status index                                  uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size

The database should be empty except for the CloudEntryPoint, a
SessionTemplate, and a Configuration.  This command can be rerun
without problems if you have trouble.

To avoid conflicts with the migration, we will remove those documents
that have been created automatically.  Execute the following
commands::

  $ curl -XDELETE http://$ES_HOST:9200/slipstream-cloud-entry-point/_doc/cloud-entry-point?pretty=true
  $ curl -XDELETE http://$ES_HOST:9200/slipstream-session-template/_doc/internal?pretty=true
  $ curl -XDELETE http://$ES_HOST:9200/slipstream-configuration/_doc/slipstream?pretty=true

This removes those autogenerated documents, which will be replace
during the migration process. 
  
Now that the new Elasticsearch database has been prepared, you are
ready to migrate documents from the old database to the new one.  **To
ensure that you have a coherent, all of the SlipStream services must
be shutdown.** Verify that this is the case.

The organization of the documents in Elasticsearch has changed.  In
ES5, all the document types were stored in a single index.  In ES6,
each document type is in a separate index.  Because of this, the
migration of documents from the old database to the new one will be
done document type by document type.

To reduce the repetition, you may want to create a script to make the
process easier::

  #!/bin/bash -x                                                                                                                                        

  DOC_TYPE=$1

  if [ -n "$DOC_TYPE" ]; then
    time lein with-profile +dbcopy run -- \
         --src-host es5-01.example.com \
         --src-type $DOC_TYPE \
         --dest-host es6-01.example.com \
         --dest-index slipstream-$DOC_TYPE
  fi

**Be sure to replace the hostnames in the script with your
hostnames.** You can then just provide the type argument to migrate a
given class of documents.  We call this script ``dbcopy.sh`` and set
execution permission with ``chmod a+x dbcopy.sh``.

Now to migrate the user resources, do the following::

  $ ./dbcopy.sh user

When the command finishes, you should see a message like the
following::

  18-05-15 07:14:04 ...  - finished copy documents from ["resources-index" "user" :_search] - [788 788 788]

showing the number of documents copied.  (The script will also show
the elapsed time.) The numbers in the tuple should all be the same.

Repeat this process for all of the resource types in your listing of
Elasticsearch indices above.  You can skip some document types: for
example, do not copy the "session" resources if you do not want to
maintain open sessions or do not copy the "metering" resources if you
do not care about past usage information.

Once the migration is complete, you can upgrade your SlipStream
installation and configure the services to use the new database.

v3.49 - 13 April 2018
---------------------

External Object now has two types: generic and report.  The latter one
is used for storing the deployment reports. The ``generic`` one can be
used by anyone willing to store data on clouds' Object Store.  For
details `see
<http://ssdocs.sixsq.com/en/latest/tutorials/ss/data-management-model.html>`_.

For Everyone:
 - Fix access to a metering resource details by its identifier
 - CIMI connector collection is now searchable by users
 - Fix User interface issues related to long usernames in logout
   button, breadcrumbs, and session information panel.
 - CIMI filter interface: fix cursor position into input when using
   controlled value
 - Usage page: default period, sorting of results
 - Login button: separated from dropdowns for federated logins

For Dave:
 - Fix number of taken entries in zookeeper which should always be
   equal to number of threads used by job executors
 - Fix deletion of api key/secret
 - Fix User registration callback when validating an email
 - Service configuration is dynamically refreshed on Configuration
   singleton from backend
 - Specify the version of nginx to be installed (in order to prevent a
   conflict with configuration files)

Migration
~~~~~~~~~

This release moves the configuration of the S3 backend for reports
from ``/opt/slipstream/server/.credentials/object-store-conf.edn``
file to the ``configuration/slipstream`` resource.

The following migration steps are required.

1. After the upgrade of the packages make sure that elasticsearch
   service is running: ``systemctl start elasticserach``

2. Create the following JSON file::

    # cat configuration-slipstream.edn
    {
      :id "configuration/slipstream"
      :slipstreamVersion "3.49"
      :reportsObjectStoreBucketName "<bucket-name>"
      :reportsObjectStoreCreds      "credential/<CHANGE-ME-UUID>"
      }

    
   The value for ``<bucket-name>`` should either be taken from your
   previous configuration file
   ``/opt/slipstream/server/.credentials/object-store-conf.edn``
   (where it is defined as ``:reportsBucketName``) or you can define a
   new name.  Note, that according to the S3 standard, the bucket name
   should be unique on the S3 endpoint.
  
   The value for ``:reportsObjectStoreCreds`` should be the URI of the
   credential that you intend to be used for storing the reports of
   the SlipStream users.  Because each credential refers to a
   connector, you have to make sure that the connector (and, hence,
   IaaS cloud) behind the credential implements and actually exposes
   S3 endpoint.  All the connectors were updated to provide an extra
   configuration option ``:objectStoreEndpoint``.  It has to be set to
   a valid S3 endpoint before the persistence of the user deployment
   reports can be done.

3. After the configuration file is ready, run the following command to actually
   configure the service::

   # ss-config configuration-slipstream.edn
   #
  
4. Delete the previous configuration file::

   # rm -f /opt/slipstream/server/.credentials/object-store-conf.edn
   #

The configuration can always be updated via web UI by going to
``https://<ss-host>/webui/cimi/configuration/slipstream`` resource and
editing the configuration document there.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to this `bug
<https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamServer/issues/1480>`_, the
credential chosen for persisting the user reports should be shared
with all the users of the SlipStream instance. This should be avoided
though.  Thus, either do not upgrade to v3.49 or apply the patch as
describe below.

How to patch SS instance: Check this patch release
https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamServer/releases/tag/v3.49.1.
It provides a patched jar with the issue #1480 fixed.  Please see the
details on how to patch your instance there.

Next release `v3.50` will contain the fix.

v3.48 - 23 March 2018
---------------------

This is primarily a bug fix release that makes improvements for
SlipStream administrators.

For Everyone:
 - A `usage page <https://nuv.la/webui/usage>`_ is gradually replacing
   the automatic usage report email. The page is internationalized.

For Clara:
 - The CIMI externalObject resource has been extended to include an
   optional ``filename`` attribute, making downloads of the
   referenced objects easier.

For Dave:
 - Add compatibility with Python 2.6 to the SlipStream bootstapping
   code so that images like Centos6 can be deployed.
 - Fixed bug where the OpenStack connector always tried to get a
   floating IP even when the feature was disabled.
 - When logged in as an administrator, the pages now load much more
   quickly.

Alice, Bob, Clara, and Dave can be found
`here <http://sixsq.com/personae/>`_.

Migration
~~~~~~~~~

Since reports are stored on S3, credentials should temporarily be set
manually in
``/opt/slipstream/server/.credentials/object-store-conf.edn`` file,
following the below format::

   {:key                 "<KEY>"
    :secret              "<SECRET>"
    :objectStoreEndpoint "<ENDPOINT>"
    :reportsBucketName   "<REPORTS_BUCKET_NAME>"}

Note that the location and format of the file have changed since the
previous release.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When opening the usage page, the default time period will not be set
  until the ``filter`` is opened and the calendar objects are
  initialized.

v3.47 - 9 March 2018
--------------------

This is primarily a bug fix release that makes improvements for
SlipStream administrators.

For Everyone:
 - The size of the application deployments are limited as described in
   the `scaling guidelines
   <http://hn-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/researcher/scaling-guidelines.html>`_.
 - Fixed a problem where new users had to edit their profiles before
   the account could be used.

For Clara:
 - The CIMI externalObject resource has been extended to include an
   optional ``content-type`` attribute, making downloads of the
   referenced objects easier.
 - The editing process for resources through the new browser interface
   has been improved.

For Dave:
 - The documentation has a new section about using a Docker container
   for SlipStream builds.
 - Fixed an issue with the Job executor where it would send large
   numbers of useless requests to the CIMI server.
 - The `Nashorn library <http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/>`_
   replaces the (now deprecated) PhantomJS for clojurescript unit
   tests.
 - User roles are added to the request for API key/secret generation
   when provisioning VMs.
