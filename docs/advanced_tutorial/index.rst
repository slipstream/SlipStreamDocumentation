Advanced Tutorial
=================

This hands-on training course will demonstrate the core features of
SlipStream by building two example applications through a series of
exercises.  The tutorial will show how SlipStream:

 - Abstracts away differences between clouds, making **cloud
   portability** possible 
 - Speeds application development by **promoting reuse** of
   parameterized application components,
 - Ensures **consistent, fast, and error-free deployment** of
   applications through automation,
 - Coordinates the configuration of an application's component
   services to ensure **reliable initialization**,
 - Improves reliability through geo-redundant services in
   **multi-cloud deployments**,
 - Provides **universal access** through a web-base UI, command line
   interface, and a REST API, and
 - Optimizes resource use though **horizontal and vertical scaling**.

The tutorial starts with a short description of the cloud ecosystem
and SlipStream's place within it.  It then describes the prerequisites
for following the tutorial before jumping into the development of the
example applications.

As the exercises build on one another, readers will want to follow the
tutorial in order.
