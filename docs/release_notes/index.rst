SlipStream Releases
===================

Production deployments should use recent stable releases. The latest
**stable release** is **v3.14**.

SixSq also produces a **candidate release** after each development
iteration (sprint). These provide a peek at new features. Feedback on
these releases is welcome, but they should not be used in production.
