Using another device such as laptop, smartphone or tablet (not included) connect to the NuvlaBox Wi-Fi or LAN network.
This connection give you access to a local SlipStream and allows you later on to access your running virtual machines.

You can see the NuvlaBox as your private *mini* IaaS_ Cloud.  And as with any IaaS Cloud you
want a friendly SaaS_ or PaaS_ service to help you with building and deploying
applications on IaaS.  This is where SlipStream comes into the picture.  As with
any onther Clouds, SlipStream can be used to manage your applications on your
NuvlaBox(s).
