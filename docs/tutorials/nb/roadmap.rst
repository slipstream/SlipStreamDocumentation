Roadmap
=======

SixSq produces a new, incremental release of NuvlaBox approximately every two months.

In addition to the continual bugfixing, robustness, and usability improvements, 
there are several areas where important new functionalities are planned:

Software improvements:

- Creating a dedicated UI for managing NuvlaBoxes
- Make admin UI visible from the remote SlipStream
- Cleanup of built images from SlipStream
- Make NuvlaBox support containers

Your feedback on what features youâ€™d like to see in NuvlaBox is important. We continuously adjust our development priorities based on user feedback. Give us your feedback by contacting us at support@sixsq.com.
