Module IV - Scalable Applications (Advanced)
--------------------------------------------

In this module you will learn how to: deploy an application that can
be scaled horizontally and vertically; scale an application through
the API; respond to resource changes to update configurations; and
automate the scaling process.

The module requires a good knowledge of the core application creation
and management features of SlipStream.  If necessary, review the
material in :doc:`Module III <module-3>`.
