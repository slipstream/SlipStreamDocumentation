Introduction
============

Developed by SixSq, **SlipStream is a multi-cloud application management
platform**. It automates the full application management lifecycle,
including the deployment, testing, certification and optimization of the
application, within Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud
infrastructures.

The software's features appeal to a wide variety of different users:

-  *End-users* will use SlipStream as an **application provisioning
   engine** to deploy virtual machines as well as full services, such as
   data analysis clusters. Users will find that SlipStream's multi-cloud
   support makes deploying resources into different cloud
   infrastructures uniform and transparent.

-  *Service providers* can use SlipStream to define customized images
   and full systems (batch clusters, LAMP applications, analysis
   platforms, etc.), creating a **rich catalog of services** that
   end-users can deploy with the click of a button.

-  *Software developers* will be thrilled with SlipStream's ability to
   provide dynamic, near-production environments for **realistic testing
   of full software systems**. Multi-cloud support takes this testing to
   the next level, allowing the behavior of systems to be tested over
   the wide area network.

-  *DevOps practitioners* can take advantage of SlipStream's automation
   and scaling capabilities to **deploy, maintain, and optimize
   production applications** in multiple cloud infrastructures.

This tutorial provides a quick overview of the cloud ecosystem and
describes where SlipStream fits in. After that, it describes the key
features of SlipStream and how to get started using it. The final part
of the tutorial is a series of examples that demonstrate specific
features of SlipStream. As the examples build on one another and become
increasingly more complex, readers will want to follow the tutorial in
order.
